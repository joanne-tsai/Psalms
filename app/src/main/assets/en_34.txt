Of David, when he feigned madness before Abimelech, who drove him out and he went away.
 
 
I   (2 - 4)
I will bless the LORD at all times;
his praise shall be always in my mouth.
 
My soul will glory in the LORD;
let the poor hear and be glad.
 
Magnify the LORD with me;
and let us exalt his name together.
 
 
II   (5 - 11)
I sought the LORD, and he answered me,
delivered me from all my fears.
 
Look to him and be radiant,
and your faces may not blush for shame.
 
This poor one cried out and the LORD heard,
and from all his distress he saved him.
 
The angel of the LORD encamps
around those who fear him, and he saves them.
 
Taste and see that the LORD is good;
blessed is the stalwart one who takes refuge in him.
 
Fear the LORD, you his holy ones;
nothing is lacking to those who fear him.
 
The rich grow poor and go hungry,
but those who seek the LORD lack no good thing.
 
 
III   (12 - 23) 
Come, children, listen to me;
I will teach you fear of the LORD.
 
Who is the man who delights in life,
who loves to see the good days?
 
Keep your tongue from evil,
your lips from speaking lies.
 
Turn from evil and do good;
seek peace and pursue it.
 
The eyes of the LORD are directed toward the righteous
and his ears toward their cry.
 
The LORDâ€™s face is against evildoers
to wipe out their memory from the earth.
 
The righteous cry out, the LORD hears
and he rescues them from all their afflictions.
 
The LORD is close to the brokenhearted,
saves those whose spirit is crushed.
 
Many are the troubles of the righteous,
but the LORD delivers him from them all.
 
He watches over all his bones;
not one of them shall be broken.
 
Evil will slay the wicked;
those who hate the righteous are condemned.
 
The LORD is the redeemer of the souls of his servants;
and none are condemned who take refuge in him.
