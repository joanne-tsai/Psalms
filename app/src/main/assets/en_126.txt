A song of ascents.
 
I   (1 - 4)
When the LORD restored the captives of Zion,
we thought we were dreaming.
 
Then our mouths were filled with laughter;
our tongues sang for joy.
Then it was said among the nations,
“The LORD had done great things for them.”
 
The LORD has done great things for us;
Oh, how happy we were!
 
Restore our captives, LORD,
like the dry stream beds of the Negeb.
 
II   (5 - 6)
Those who sow in tears
will reap with cries of joy.
 
Those who go forth weeping,
carrying sacks of seed,
Will return with cries of joy,
carrying their bundled sheaves.
