A psalm of David.
 
(1 - 6)
LORD, hear my prayer;
in your faithfulness listen to my pleading;
answer me in your righteousness.
 
Do not enter into judgment with your servant;
before you no one can be just.
 
The enemy has pursued my soul;
he has crushed my life to the ground.
He has made me dwell in darkness
like those long dead.
 
My spirit is faint within me;
my heart despairs.
 
I remember the days of old;
I ponder all your deeds;
the works of your hands I recall.
 
I stretch out my hands toward you,
my soul to you like a parched land.
Selah
 
(7 - 12)
Hasten to answer me, LORD;
for my spirit fails me.
Do not hide your face from me,
lest I become like those descending to the pit.
 
In the morning let me hear of your mercy,
for in you I trust.
Show me the path I should walk,
for I entrust my life to you.
 
Rescue me, LORD, from my foes,
for I seek refuge in you.
 
Teach me to do your will,
for you are my God.
May your kind spirit guide me
on ground that is level.
 
For your nameâ€™s sake, LORD, give me life;
in your righteousness lead my soul out of distress.
 
In your mercy put an end to my foes;
all those who are oppressing my soul,
for I am your servant.
