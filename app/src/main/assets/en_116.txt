I   (1 - 4)
I love the LORD, who listened
to my voice in supplication,
 
Who turned an ear to me
on the day I called.
 
I was caught by the cords of death;
the snares of Sheol had seized me;
I felt agony and dread.
 
Then I called on the name of the LORD,
“O LORD, save my life!”
 
II   (5 - 9)
Gracious is the LORD and righteous;
yes, our God is merciful.
 
The LORD protects the simple;
I was helpless, but he saved me.
 
Return, my soul, to your rest;
the LORD has been very good to you.
 
For my soul has been freed from death,
my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling.
 
I shall walk before the LORD
in the land of the living.
 
III   (10 - 19)
I kept faith, even when I said,
“I am greatly afflicted!”
 
I said in my alarm,
“All men are liars!”
 
How can I repay the LORD
for all the great good done for me?
 
I will raise the cup of salvation
and call on the name of the LORD.
 
I will pay my vows to the LORD
in the presence of all his people.
 
Dear in the eyes of the LORD
is the death of his devoted.
 
LORD, I am your servant,
your servant, the child of your maidservant;
you have loosed my bonds.
 
I will offer a sacrifice of praise
and call on the name of the LORD.
 
I will pay my vows to the LORD
in the presence of all his people,
 
In the courts of the house of the LORD,
in your midst, O Jerusalem.
Hallelujah!
