A psalm of David.
 
 
 
I   (1 - 2)
Give to the LORD, you sons of God,
give to the LORD glory and might;
 
Give to the LORD the glory due his name.
Bow down before the LORD’s holy splendor!
 


II   (3 - 9)
The voice of the LORD is over the waters;
the God of glory thunders,
the LORD, over the mighty waters.
 
The voice of the LORD is power;
the voice of the LORD is splendor.
 
The voice of the LORD cracks the cedars;
the LORD splinters the cedars of Lebanon,
 
Makes Lebanon leap like a calf,
and Sirion like a young bull.
 
The voice of the LORD strikes with fiery flame;
 
the voice of the LORD shakes the desert;
the LORD shakes the desert of Kadesh.
 
The voice of the LORD makes the deer dance
and strips the forests bare.
All in his Temple say, “Glory!”
 


III   (10 - 11)
The LORD sits enthroned above the flood!
The LORD reigns as king forever!
 
May the LORD give might to his people;
may the LORD bless his people with peace!
