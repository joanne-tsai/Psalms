I   (1 - 5)
Rejoice, you righteous, in the LORD;
praise from the upright is fitting.
 
Give thanks to the LORD on the harp;
on the ten-stringed lyre offer praise.
 
Sing to him a new song;
skillfully play with joyful chant.
 
For the LORD’s word is upright;
all his works are trustworthy.
 
He loves justice and right.
The earth is full of the mercy of the LORD.
 
II   (6 - 7)
By the LORD’s word the heavens were made;
by the breath of his mouth all their host.
 
He gathered the waters of the sea as a mound;
he sets the deep into storage vaults.
 
III   (8 - 12)
Let all the earth fear the LORD;
let all who dwell in the world show him reverence.
 
For he spoke, and it came to be,
commanded, and it stood in place.
 
The LORD foils the plan of nations,
frustrates the designs of peoples.
 
But the plan of the LORD stands forever,
the designs of his heart through all generations.
 
Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD,
the people chosen as his inheritance.
 
IV (13 - 15)
From heaven the LORD looks down
and observes the children of Adam,
 
From his dwelling place he surveys
all who dwell on earth.
 
The One who fashioned together their hearts
is the One who knows all their works.
 
V   (16 - 19)
A king is not saved by a great army,
nor a warrior delivered by great strength.
 
Useless is the horse for safety;
despite its great strength, it cannot be saved.
 
Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon those who fear him,
upon those who count on his mercy,
 
To deliver their soul from death,
and to keep them alive through famine.
 
VI   (20 - 22)
Our soul waits for the LORD,
He is our help and shield.
 
For in him our hearts rejoice;
in his holy name we trust.
 
May your mercy, LORD, be upon us;
as we put our hope in you.
