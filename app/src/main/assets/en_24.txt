A psalm of David.
 
I   (1 - 2)
The earth is the LORD’s and all it holds,
the world and those who dwell in it.
 
For he founded it on the seas,
established it over the rivers.
 
II   (3 - 6)
Who may go up the mountain of the LORD?
Who can stand in his holy place?
 
“The clean of hand and pure of heart,
who has not given his soul to useless things,
what is vain.
 
He will receive blessings from the LORD,
and justice from his saving God.
 
Such is the generation that seeks him,
that seeks the face of the God of Jacob.”
Selah
 
III   (7 - 10)
Lift up your heads, O gates;
be lifted, you ancient portals,
that the king of glory may enter.
 
Who is this king of glory?
The LORD, strong and mighty,
the LORD, mighty in war.
 
Lift up your heads, O gates;
rise up, you ancient portals,
that the king of glory may enter.
 
Who is this king of glory?
The LORD of hosts, he is the king of glory.
