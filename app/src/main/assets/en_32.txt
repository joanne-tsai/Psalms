Of David. A maskil.
 
I   (1 - 2)
Blessed is the one whose fault is removed,
whose sin is forgiven.
 
Blessed is the man to whom the LORD imputes no guilt,
in whose spirit is no deceit.
 
II   (3 - 7)
Because I kept silent, my bones wasted away;
I groaned all day long.
 
For day and night your hand was heavy upon me;
my strength withered as in dry summer heat.
Selah
 
Then I declared my sin to you;
my guilt I did not hide.
I said, “I confess my transgression to the LORD,”
and you took away the guilt of my sin.
Selah
 
Therefore every loyal person should pray to you
in time of distress.
Though flood waters threaten,
they will never reach him.
 
You are my shelter; you guard me from distress;
with joyful shouts of deliverance you surround me.
Selah
 
III   (8 - 9)
I will instruct you and show you the way you should walk,
give you counsel with my eye upon you.
 
Do not be like a horse or mule, without understanding;
with bit and bridle their temper is curbed,
else they will not come to you.
 
IV   (10 - 11)
Many are the sorrows of the wicked one,
but mercy surrounds the one who trusts in the LORD.
 
Be glad in the LORD and rejoice, you righteous;
exult, all you upright of heart.
