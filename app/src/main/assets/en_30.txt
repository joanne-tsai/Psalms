A psalm. A song for the dedication of the Temple. Of David.
 
I   (2 - 4)
I praise you, LORD, for you raised me up
and did not let my enemies rejoice over me.
 
O LORD, my God,
I cried out to you for help and you healed me.
 
LORD, you brought my soul up from Sheol;
you let me live, from going down to the pit.
 
II   (5 - 6)
Sing praise to the LORD, you faithful;
give thanks to his holy memory.
 
For his anger lasts but a moment;
his favor a lifetime.
At dusk weeping comes for the night;
but at dawn there is rejoicing.
 
III   (7 - 11)
Complacent, I once said,
“I shall never be shaken.”
 
LORD, you showed me favor,
established for me mountains of virtue.
But when you hid your face
I was struck with terror.
 
To you, LORD, I cried out;
with the Lord I pleaded for mercy:
 
“What gain is there from my lifeblood,
from my going down to the grave?
Does dust give you thanks
or declare your faithfulness?
 
Hear, O LORD, have mercy on me;
LORD, be my helper.”
 
IV   (12 - 13)
You changed my mourning into dancing;
you took off my sackcloth
and clothed me with gladness.
 
So that my glory may praise you
and not be silent.
O LORD, my God,
forever will I give you thanks.
