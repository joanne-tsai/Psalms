A
I   (1 - 3)
The LORD is my light and my salvation;
whom should I fear?
The LORD is my life’s refuge;
of whom should I be afraid?
 
When evildoers come at me
to devour my flesh,
These my enemies and foes
themselves stumble and fall.
 
Though an army encamp against me,
my heart does not fear;
Though war be waged against me,
even then do I trust.
II   (4 - 6)
One thing I ask of the LORD;
this I seek:
To dwell in the LORD’s house
all the days of my life,
To gaze on the LORD’s beauty,
to visit his temple.
 
For God will hide me in his shelter
in time of trouble,
He will conceal me in the cover of his tent;
and set me high upon a rock.
 
Even now my head is held high
above my enemies on every side!
I will offer in his tent
sacrifices with shouts of joy;
I will sing and chant praise to the LORD.
 
B
I   (7 - 10)
Hear my voice, LORD, when I call;
have mercy on me and answer me.
 
“Come,” says my heart, “seek his face”;
your face, LORD, do I seek!
 
Do not hide your face from me;
do not repel your servant in anger.
You are my salvation; do not cast me off;
do not forsake me, God my savior!
 
Even if my father and mother forsake me,
the LORD will take me in.
 
II   (11 - 14)
LORD, show me your way;
lead me on a level path
because of my enemies.
 
Do not abandon me to the desire of my foes;
malicious and lying witnesses have risen against me.
 
I believe I shall see the LORD’s goodness
in the land of the living.
 
Wait for the LORD, take courage;
be stouthearted, wait for the LORD!
