 
A psalm.
 
I   (1 - 3)
Sing a new song to the LORD,
for he has done marvelous deeds.
His right hand and holy arm
have won the victory.
 
The LORD has made his victory known;
has revealed his triumph in the sight of the nations,
 
He has remembered his mercy and faithfulness
toward the house of Israel.
All the ends of the earth have seen
the victory of our God.
 
II   (4 - 6)
Shout with joy to the LORD, all the earth;
break into song; sing praise.
 
Sing praise to the LORD with the lyre,
with the lyre and melodious song.
 
With trumpets and the sound of the horn
shout with joy to the King, the LORD.
 
III   (7 - 9)
Let the sea and what fills it resound,
the world and those who dwell there.
 
Let the rivers clap their hands,
the mountains shout with them for joy,
 
Before the LORD who comes,
who comes to govern the earth,
To govern the world with justice
and the peoples with fairness.
