A song of ascents.
 
(1-4)
To you I raise my eyes,
to you enthroned in heaven.
 
Yes, like the eyes of servants
on the hand of their masters,
Like the eyes of a maid
on the hand of her mistress,
So our eyes are on the LORD our God,
till we are shown favor.
 
Show us favor, LORD, show us favor,
for we have our fill of contempt.
 
Our souls are more than sated
with mockery from the insolent,
with contempt from the arrogant.
