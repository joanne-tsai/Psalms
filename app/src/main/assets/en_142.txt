A maskil of David, when he was in the cave. A prayer.
 
(2 - 8)
With my own voice I cry to the LORD;
with my own voice I beseech the LORD.
 
Before him I pour out my complaint,
tell of my distress in front of him.
 
When my spirit is faint within me,
you know my path.
As I go along this path,
they have hidden a trap for me.
 
I look to my right hand to see
that there is no one willing to acknowledge me.
My escape has perished;
no one cares for me.
 
I cry out to you, LORD,
I say, You are my refuge,
my portion in the land of the living.
 
Listen to my cry for help,
for I am brought very low.
Rescue me from my pursuers,
for they are too strong for me.
 
Lead my soul from prison,
that I may give thanks to your name.
Then the righteous shall gather around me
because you have been good to me.
