I   (1 - 5)
Come, let us sing joyfully to the LORD;
cry out to the rock of our salvation.
 
Let us come before him with a song of praise,
joyfully sing out our psalms.
 
For the LORD is the great God,
the great king over all gods,
 
Whose hand holds the depths of the earth;
who owns the tops of the mountains.
 
The sea and dry land belong to God,
who made them, formed them by hand.
 
 
II   (6 - 7)
Enter, let us bow down in worship;
let us kneel before the LORD who made us.
 
For he is our God,
we are the people he shepherds,
the sheep in his hands.
 
 
 
III   (8 - 11)
Oh, that today you would hear his voice:
 
Do not harden your hearts as at Meribah,
as on the day of Massah in the desert.
 
There your ancestors tested me;
they tried me though they had seen my works.
 
Forty years I loathed that generation;
I said: “This people’s heart goes astray;
they do not know my ways.”
 
Therefore I swore in my anger:
“They shall never enter my rest.”
