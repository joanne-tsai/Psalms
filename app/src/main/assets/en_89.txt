A maskil of Ethan the Ezrahite.

I  (1 - 5)
I will sing of your mercy forever, LORD
proclaim your faithfulness through all ages.
 
For I said, “My mercy is established forever;
my faithfulness will stand as long as the heavens.
 
I have made a covenant with my chosen one;
I have sworn to David my servant:
 
I will make your dynasty stand forever
and establish your throne through all ages.”
Selah
 
II   (6 -19)
The heavens praise your marvels, LORD,
your loyalty in the assembly of the holy ones.
 
Who in the skies ranks with the LORD?
Who is like the LORD among the sons of the gods?
 
A God dreaded in the council of the holy ones,
greater and more awesome than all those around him!
 
LORD, God of hosts, who is like you?
Mighty LORD, your faithfulness surrounds you.
 
You rule the raging sea;
you still its swelling waves.
 
You crush Rahab with a mortal blow;
with your strong arm you scatter your foes.
 
Yours are the heavens, yours the earth;
you founded the world and everything in it.
 
Zaphon and Amanus you created;
Tabor and Hermon rejoice in your name.
 
You have a mighty arm.
Your hand is strong; your right hand is ever exalted.
 
Justice and judgment are the foundation of your throne;
mercy and faithfulness march before you.
 
Blessed the people who know the war cry,
who walk in the radiance of your face, LORD.
 
In your name they sing joyfully all the day;
they rejoice in your righteousness.
 
You are their majestic strength;
by your favor our horn is exalted.
 
Truly the LORD is our shield,
the Holy One of Israel, our king!
 
III   (20 - 38)
Then you spoke in vision;
to your faithful ones you said:
“I have set a leader over the warriors;
I have raised up a chosen one from the people.
 
I have chosen David, my servant;
with my holy oil I have anointed him.
 
My hand will be with him;
my arm will make him strong.
 
No enemy shall outwit him,
nor shall the wicked defeat him.
 
I will crush his foes before him,
strike down those who hate him.
 
My faithfulness and mercy will be with him;
through my name his horn will be exalted.
 
I will set his hand upon the sea,
his right hand upon the rivers.
 
He shall cry to me, ‘You are my father,
my God, the Rock of my salvation!’
 
I myself make him the firstborn,
Most High over the kings of the earth.
 
Forever I will maintain my mercy for him;
my covenant with him stands firm.
 
I will establish his dynasty forever,
his throne as the days of the heavens.
 
If his descendants forsake my teaching,
do not follow my decrees,
 
If they fail to observe my statutes,
do not keep my commandments,
 
I will punish their crime with a rod
and their guilt with blows.
 
But I will not take my mercy from him,
nor will I betray my bond of faithfulness.
 
I will not violate my covenant;
the promise of my lips I will not alter.
 
By my holiness I swore once for all:
I will never be false to David.
 
His dynasty will continue forever,
his throne, like the sun before me.
 
Like the moon it will stand eternal,
forever firm like the sky!”
Selah

IV   (39 - 46)
But now you have rejected and spurned,
been enraged at your anointed.
 
You renounced the covenant with your servant,
defiled his crown in the dust.
 
You broke down all city walls,
left his strongholds in ruins.
 
All who pass through seize plunder;
his neighbors deride him.
 
You have exalted the right hand of his foes,
have gladdened all his enemies.
 
You turned back his sharp sword,
did not support him in battle.
 
You brought to an end his splendor,
hurled his throne to the ground.
 
You cut short the days of his youth,
covered him with shame.
Selah
 
V (47 - 49)
How long, LORD? Will you hide forever?
Must your wrath smolder like fire?
 
Remember how brief life is,
how frail the sons of man you have created!
 
What is man, that he should live and not see death?
Who can deliver his soul from the power of Sheol?
Selah
 
VI (50 - 53)
Where are your former mercies, Lord,
that you swore to David in your faithfulness?
 
Remember, Lord, the insults to your servants,
how I have borne in my bosom the slander of the nations.
 
Your enemies, LORD, insult;
they insult each step of your anointed.
 
Blessed be the LORD forever! Amen and amen!
