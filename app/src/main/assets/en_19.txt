For the leader. A psalm of David.
 
I    (2 - 7)
The heavens declare the glory of God;
the firmament proclaims the works of his hands.
 
Day unto day pours forth speech;
night unto night whispers knowledge.
 
There is no speech, no words;
their voice is not heard;
 
A report goes forth through all the earth,
their messages, to the ends of the world.
He has pitched in them a tent for the sun;
 
it comes forth like a bridegroom from his canopy,
and like a hero joyfully runs its course.
 
From one end of the heavens it comes forth;
its course runs through to the other;
nothing escapes its heat.
 
II    (8 - 12)
The law of the LORD is perfect,
refreshing the soul.
The decree of the LORD is trustworthy,
giving wisdom to the simple.
 
The precepts of the LORD are right,
rejoicing the heart.
The command of the LORD is clear,
enlightening the eye.
 
The fear of the LORD is pure,
enduring forever.
The statutes of the LORD are true,
all of them just;
 
More desirable than gold,
than a hoard of purest gold,
Sweeter also than honey
or drippings from the comb.
 
By them your servant is warned;
obeying them brings much reward.
 
III    (13 - 15)
Who can detect trespasses?
Cleanse me from my inadvertent sins.
 
Also from arrogant ones restrain your servant;
let them never control me.
Then shall I be blameless,
innocent of grave sin.
 
Let the words of my mouth be acceptable,
the thoughts of my heart before you,
LORD, my rock and my redeemer.
